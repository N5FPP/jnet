**PLEASE READ**

Thanks for checking out JNeT!

Please understand that this is a personal experiment so *I* will *not* provide
any kind of personalized support, or fulfill third-party feature requests.

The API is unstable and can (will) change at any time. Only rely on these crates
is you are OK with API instability.

Also I don't intend to publish these crates on crates.io any time soon so please
don't ask.

Thanks for your understanding,

@japaric
